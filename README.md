# Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of this project is to build a text classification model capable of predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. 
The model is trained using the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for natural language processing tasks. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and sentiment prediction for new reviews.
